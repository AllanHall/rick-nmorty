# Rick and Morty

<p>Creating a Rick and Morty site was a blast! Had a lot of fun with the styling and really started to get a grasp of API's, hooks and react-router-dom.

<p>Objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Created the site using React
    </li>
    <li>
    Used Axios to retrieve the data from the <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com">API</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    Used hooks to dynamically change the data 
    </li>
    <li>
    Implemented react-router-dom to dynamically create webpages
    </li>
  </ul>
